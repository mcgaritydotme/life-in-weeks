👋 Hi, I'm [Matthew](https://mcgarity.me). This is a map of my life, where each week I've been alive is a little box. Hover over a box to see what I was doing where that week.

📍 Read more about [Life in Weeks at Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). I adapted the code that generated this page from [Gina Trapani's own concept](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks), which itself was based on [Buster Benson's](https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks).

🌱 This life and this map are a work in progress. I'll update it as I go.
